# winter_task
This project is a blog made on django. In this, a user can create his id and add posts. User can also follow
other users and see their profiles and posts. User can comment on others posts also.

To prevent cyber crime, if a user deletes his post, his log gets saved in a folder and i can see the post that is deleted.
I will also add a feature to report a post so that the post gets automatically deleted.
